# Oracle-User-Assistance-Developer-Writing-Exercise  

My Experience performing the tasks in the exercise was good. I was able to understand the instructions.  

I first downloaded the Docker setup and installed it. However after installation it was not working. I used the internet to find
that I had not installed WSL Ubuntu which was a pre-requisite. The solution in the image below was useful.

After following the instructions, Docker was working properly. I performed the tasks in the exercise and did not encounter any other issue.

Finally I opened Docker and found the app in the container section.

### Suggestions to make Experience better 

I would suggest to make the instructions regarding installation more clear. The instruction i found on the internet was more
clear and even included the potential error i might encounter and how to resolve that.
